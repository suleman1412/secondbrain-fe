# SecondBrain Application

## SecondBrain ðŸ“šðŸ§   
A modern knowledge management tool that empowers users to save, organize, and efficiently search through their personal knowledge base.

### Key Features  
- **Vector Search Implementation**:  
  - Enhanced search functionality using a vector database for semantic and contextual searches.  
  - Enables users to retrieve information based on intent and meaning, not just keywords.

- **Custom UI Library**:  
  - Developed a UI library from scratch for a seamless and user-friendly experience.  
  - Features modular and reusable components tailored for this application.

- **Link Organization**:  
  - Add links (videos, articles, etc.) with titles and tags for better categorization.  
  - Supports tagging for flexible organization and retrieval.  

- **Authentication**:  
  - Includes normal authentication to ensure user data privacy and security.  

- **MongoDB Integration**:  
  - Persistent data storage for all links, tags, and user information.

### Technologies Used  
- **Frontend**: Custom UI components built with [your stack, e.g., React/Tailwind/Vanilla JS].  
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js for API handling and authentication.  
- **Database**: MongoDB for structured data storage and a vector database for search indexing.  
- **Search**: Semantic search powered by vector embeddings.
